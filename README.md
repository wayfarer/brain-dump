# Brain Dump

A reverse chatbot that interviews you to build a structured, queryable record of your life — not a transcript, but a tagged chronology of moments, memories, and facts that can be searched, grouped, and exported.

## Concept

Most chat interfaces let the user drive. Brain Dump inverts that: the model is the interviewer, asking one good question at a time. The user remembers and responds. Out of that exchange a structured record accumulates.

## Segments

A **segment** is an interview domain — a configured opening question, system prompt, and tag style. Different segments capture different kinds of material but share the same underlying schema.

- **Life Story** (default, always available) — opens with the hardcoded question `"What is your first memory?"`. Its record serves as the user's foundational memory context that other segments can draw on as background.
- **Future segments** — dream journals, project retrospectives, family history, medical history, and other directed-interview domains. Each carries its own prompt configuration but writes into the same data model.

## Data Model

Each node captures one response — one moment, fact, or memory.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | |
| `tag` | string | 1–4 word LLM-extracted label. Indexed. |
| `content` | string | The user's response text. Full-text searchable. |
| `parent_id` | UUID \| null | Follow-up chain within an interview branch. |
| `captured_at` | timestamp | Always precise. When the interview recorded the node. |
| `memory_date` | string \| null | When the remembered event occurred. May be partial. |
| `memory_date_granularity` | enum \| null | See below. |
| `segment` | string | The segment this node belongs to. |
| `depth` | int | Distance from the root of the current branch. |

### Two timestamps

`captured_at` orders the interview sessions. `memory_date` orders the life narrative — the user's recollection of when the actual event occurred. Sorting by one or the other gives you the chronology of *capture* versus the chronology of *life*.

### Granularity

Human memory rarely surfaces with time-of-day precision. The granularity ladder reflects what memory actually carries:

- `decade` — "the 80s"
- `year` — "1987"
- `season` — "summer 1987"
- `month` — "June 1987"
- `date` — "June 14, 1987"
- `datetime` — reserved for imported synthetic data (logs, calendar entries, tooling exports). The interview pathway never produces `datetime` nodes.

`memory_date_granularity: null` means no date information was captured for this node. `memory_date` will also be null in that case. The two fields are always null together.

### Depth

`depth` is stored at insert time by the caller. Nodes are append-only — `parent_id` never changes after insert — so the stored value cannot drift from the actual tree structure.

### Segment vs. tag

`segment` is the interview domain: coarse, configured before the session starts (e.g. `life_story`, `dream_journal`). `tag` is the thematic label the LLM assigns to a specific node: fine-grained and assigned per response (e.g. `"fierce belonging"`, `"quiet shame"`). Segment is the container; tag is the lens.

### Tags

A tag is a short normalized label — `"sudden loss"`, `"fierce belonging"`, `"quiet shame"`. Tags drive aggregation: every appearance of a tag across all branches and all sessions forms a theme view. The chronology stays linear; tags are the lens through which it's queried.

The inverse query also matters: starting from a free-text phrase (`"grandmother"`, `"the cabin"`) and pulling back the *set of tags* whose nodes mention it. The LLM uses this during an interview to surface relevant prior themes without the user having to name them. Full-text search over `content` is what enables that pattern.

## Storage

SQLite via `better-sqlite3` — single file (`dump.db`), no server, WAL mode. Indexed lookups on `id`, `parent_id`, `tag`, `captured_at`, and `segment`. FTS5 full-text search on `content`, kept in sync via insert/update/delete triggers.

JSON is the canonical **export/import** format. `exportToJson` serializes the full database to a `DumpRecord` (version 2). `importFromJson` loads a v1 or v2 JSON record into SQLite — idempotent, runs in a transaction. On first startup, if a legacy `dump.json` is present and the database is empty, it is migrated automatically and renamed to `dump.json.migrated`.

## Layout

```
cli/      Interview REPL — Codex-subscription or OpenAI chat backend, node extraction
cli/backends/  Chat-backend seam: Codex app-server, OpenAI API, fallback session
study/    Data model comparison study (current focus)
src/app/  Splash page (Next.js, static for now)
```

The CLI is the primary capture interface. The web app is a splash; a graph/timeline UI is out of current scope.

## Current Status

The project is CLI-first. The README describes the intended capture, storage,
search, import, and export behavior for the interview system. The `src/app`
surface is intentionally minimal right now: it renders a static splash page and
does not read from the SQLite database.

The web app should not be treated as the primary product surface yet. Future web
work can add graph, timeline, search, or export views, but those are not part of
the current scope.

## Documentation Notes

The schema rules below are the source of truth for the current data model:

- `captured_at` records when the interview captured the node.
- `memory_date` records when the remembered event occurred, if known.
- `memory_date` and `memory_date_granularity` are always null together.
- `depth` is stored at insert time because nodes are append-only.
- `segment` is the configured interview domain.
- `tag` is the per-node thematic label extracted from the response.

## Running

### Install

```sh
npm install && npm link   # exposes `braindump` in your PATH
```

Then from anywhere:

```sh
braindump                             # Start a life_story session (default)
braindump --segment dream_journal     # Start a dream_journal session
```

Or without installing, from inside the project:

```sh
npm run dump
npm run dump -- --segment dream_journal
```

```sh
npm test                              # Run the test suite
```

### Authentication

The interview can run on either of two chat backends:

- **Codex subscription** — sign in once with `codex login` (a ChatGPT Plus/Pro account). Brain Dump drives the local `codex app-server`, so chat rides your subscription with no API billing. The Codex CLI must be installed and logged in.
- **OpenAI API key** — set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` (see `.env.example`). Used for chat when Codex isn't available, and **always** for embeddings (vector search) — the subscription doesn't expose embeddings.

Selection is automatic: Codex is used when you're logged in, otherwise the API key. Override with `--backend codex|openai|auto` or `BRAINDUMP_BACKEND`.

| Codex login | API key | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | ✅ | Codex chat; embeddings + automatic fallback on the API key |
| ✅ | — | Codex chat; retrieval degrades to full-text search (no embeddings) |
| — | ✅ | OpenAI API for everything |
| — | — | Error — run `codex login` or set `OPENAI_API_KEY` |

If the subscription hits its usage limit mid-session and an API key is set, Brain Dump prints a one-line notice and continues on the API key for the rest of the session (the subscription is retried on next launch).

### Segments

| Segment | Opening question |
|---|---|
| `life_story` | What is your first memory? |
| `dream_journal` | Tell me about a dream you remember. |

Each session writes only to its own segment. Context surfaced to the interviewer is scoped to the active segment.

### REPL commands

During a session, lines starting with `/` are handled locally without calling the LLM:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/search <query>` | Full-text search across all captured nodes. Prints matching nodes with their tag, memory date (if known), and a content preview. |
| `/list [n]` | Show the `n` most recent captured nodes (default 10). |
| `/tags` | List all tags with occurrence counts, sorted by frequency. |
| `/exit` | End the session (equivalent to Ctrl+C). |
